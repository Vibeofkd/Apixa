Apixa — Modular API & Backend Orchestration Platform for Stellar 🚀
Overview

Apixa is a modular backend orchestration platform designed for building, managing, and scaling APIs and workflows on the Stellar network. It provides a structured, composable approach to backend development by enabling deterministic request pipelines, middleware orchestration, and event-driven execution.

Apixa addresses the complexity of fragmented Stellar integrations and scattered backend logic by unifying pipeline execution, transaction handling, and monitoring into a single, extensible engine—while giving developers full control over flow design and integrations.
