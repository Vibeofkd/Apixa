Apixa — Modular API & Backend Orchestration Platform for Stellar Network

Apixa is a modular backend platform designed to build, manage, and scale APIs and workflows on the Stellar network. It enables teams to orchestrate payment flows, transaction pipelines, and smart integrations with Stellar’s decentralized ledger, providing a structured, composable approach to blockchain backend development.

Apixa solves the problem of fragmented Stellar service integrations and scattered transaction logic by providing a unified engine for pipeline execution, middleware orchestration, and event handling, while giving developers full control over payment flows, asset transfers, and integrations with Stellar’s network ecosystem.
