Apixa — Modular API & Backend Orchestration Platform

Apixa is a modular platform for building, managing, and scaling APIs and backend workflows. It enables teams to define request pipelines, orchestrate middleware, and handle events deterministically, providing a structured, composable approach to backend development.

Apixa solves the problem of fragmented backend services and scattered logic by providing a unified engine for pipeline execution, middleware orchestration, and monitoring, while giving developers full control over flows and integrations.

🚀 Core Features

Composable request pipelines: Chain middleware and handlers for reusable workflows.

Deterministic execution: Predictable request and event lifecycles with built-in error handling.

Declarative routing & orchestration: Define routes, flows, and integrations via configuration.

Modular governance over logic: Apply shared rules and policies across services.

Protocol-agnostic API handling: Support REST, events, webhooks, and internal service calls.

Web dashboard: Visualize flows, debug pipelines, and monitor metrics in real-time
