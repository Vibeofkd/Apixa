Apixa — Modular API & Backend Orchestration Platform

Apixa is a modular platform for building, managing, and scaling APIs and backend workflows. It enables teams to define request pipelines, orchestrate middleware, and handle events deterministically, providing a structured, composable approach to backend development.

Apixa solves the problem of fragmented backend services and scattered logic by providing a unified engine for pipeline execution, middleware orchestration, and monitoring, while giving developers full control over flows and integrations.
